## Where to find a help? 

GOOGLE, GOOGLE, GOOGLE. 

Try to help yourself, try to use the right words to find what you need. Try to be specific. Learn how to compose a sentence to achieve a desired goal, to find what you are looking for. Your best friend should be google, relevant pages like:

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
- https://stackoverflow.com/
- https://chat.openai.com/
- and others...

## Why?

Because in many cases you will be forced to do something new. 

You'll have to figure it out. Either you figure it out yourself using the knowledge you have, or you use something that someone has already solved before you and shared the solution. So why do some work at the beginning when someone has already solved it?

## Naming Conventions in Programming

Naming conventions in programming refer to a set of rules and guidelines for choosing names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities in code. These conventions standardize the naming style within a programming language or a project, aiming to enhance readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.

### Why Naming Conventions Matter

- **Readability**: Consistent and descriptive names make code easier to read and understand.
- **Maintainability**: Helps in maintaining and debugging code over time.
- **Collaboration**: Consistent naming conventions aid collaboration among developers.

### Best Practices

- **Be Descriptive**: Choose names that accurately describe the purpose of the variable, function, or class.
- **Consistency**: Follow the conventions used in the language or project.
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Names should be clear and unambiguous.
- **Use Meaningful Names**: Prefer readability over brevity.
- **Update Names When Needed**: Refactor names if the code functionality changes.

### Naming Conventions 

1. Camel Case

Description: Camel case is a naming convention where multiple words are joined together, and each word (except the first) begins with a capital letter. The name comes from the way the uppercase letters resemble camel humps.
Example: `camelCaseExample`, `numberOfStudents`, `calculateTotalAmount`

2. Pascal Case (Upper Camel Case)

Description: Similar to camel case, but the first letter of each word is capitalized.
Example: `PascalCaseExample`, `NumberOfStudents`, `CalculateTotalAmount`

3. Snake Case

Description: Words are connected by underscores (_). Typically used in file names or some programming languages.
Example: `snake_case_example`, `number_of_students`, `calculate_total_amount`

4. Kebab Case

Description: Words are connected by hyphens (-). Often used in URLs or file names.
Example: `kebab-case-example`, `number-of-students`, `calculate-total-amount`

5. Hungarian Notation

Description: Prefixes or type annotations are used to denote the data type of a variable.
Example: `strName` (for a string), `intAge` (for an integer), `boolIsValid` (for a boolean)

6. UPPERCASE

Description: All letters in the identifier are in uppercase.
Example: `CONSTANT_NAME`, `MAX_VALUE`, `TOTAL_COUNT`

7. lowercase

Description: All letters in the identifier are in lowercase.
Example: `variable`, `function`, `parameter`

8. Abbreviations

Description: Using shortened versions of words.
Example: `numCats` (instead of `numberOfCats`), `btnSubmit` (instead of `submitButton`)

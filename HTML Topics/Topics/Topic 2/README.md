# HTML Topic 2 - Basic Playground

Now we will practice everything we have learned so far, or from theory to practice. You will draw on the previous lesson for your work. I'll show you a sample project, then the independent work will come. 

# What to use? Do you remember them all?

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`
- `<body>`
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` - `<h6>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- `<div>`
- `<span>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `<nav>`
- `<section>`
- `<main>`
- `<form>`
- `<input>`
- `<button>`
- `<audio>`
- `<video>`
- or **GOOGLE**

# My turn

I'll start. You can watch or you can code with me.

# Your turn

Now is your time to practise all you can. Don't worry if you don't catch up. You can complete your work later whenever you want.

For your work, try to do a research for:

- HTML form fieldset
- HTML text formatting

### This is your task

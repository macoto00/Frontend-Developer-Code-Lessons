### HTML, CSS, JS Basics

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML).

JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

Together - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three pillars of frontend development; they enable you to build a holistic website.

Website development is an essential aspect of modern-day businesses and organizations, and it revolves around three fundamental technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS gives it the style and visual appeal, while JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to the page.

A good analogy to understand the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in website development is to consider them as the skeleton, beauty, and brain, respectively. Just as the skeleton provides structure and support to the human body, HTML provides the underlying structure and content of a web page. CSS, like beauty products, outfits that enhances the appearance of the website and gives it a visually pleasing design. Finally, JavaScript is like the brain that adds interactivity and functionality to the website and enables it to respond to user inputs.

### Role of HTML

- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
- HTML allows web developers to define the structure and content of a web page using a series of tags and attributes.
- HTML tags are used to create elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images, while attributes provide additional information about those elements.

### Role of CSS

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to add visual style and layout to web pages.
- CSS allows developers to define colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements of a webpage.
- CSS can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

### Role of JavaScript

- JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages.
- JavaScript allows developers to create dynamic content that responds to user input or changes in the webpage.
- JavaScript can be used to create animations, form validation, and other interactive elements on a web page.
- JavaScript is a key component of modern web development and is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and engaging web pages.

### How Browsers Works?

When a client, such as a user's you and me web browser, sends a request for a website like https://github.com/, it sends a message to a web server that hosts the website. This message includes information about the requested URL, like the domain name and the path to the specific page or resource. 

The web server then receives the request and processes it by locating the requested resource and generating a response. This response typically includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the web page, along with any additional resources like images or videos.

Once the web server has generated the response, it sends it back to the client, which is usually the user's web browser. The response is sent as a series of packets that are transmitted over the internet using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol.

The client's web browser then receives the response and interprets it using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that were included. This allows the browser to display the webpage to the user, complete with all the text, images, and interactive elements.

### URL parts 

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. In practice, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved. As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.

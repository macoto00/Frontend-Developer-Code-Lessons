# CSS Topic 1 - Basics

Here we go, we are going to make some styling, finally!

## Link CSS to HTML file

At first we need to create a files. In your folder create `index.html` and `style.css`.

Create a basic HTML file structure. Then link a CSS file to the HTML by adding 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

to the `<head>` tag. Just like that:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Basics</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
```

*POOF. You can now express yourself creatively.

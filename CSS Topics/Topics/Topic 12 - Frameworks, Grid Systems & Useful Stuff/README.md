## Why Use CSS Frameworks?

Speed and Efficiency: Frameworks expedite development by providing ready-to-use components, reducing the need for writing repetitive CSS.

Consistency: They ensure consistent styling and design across different devices and browsers.

Responsive Design: Most frameworks offer built-in responsive design components, making it easier to create mobile-friendly interfaces.

Community and Support: Frameworks often have active communities and extensive documentation, providing resources and solutions to common problems.

While CSS frameworks offer many advantages, they might not always perfectly fit every project's needs. Choosing a framework depends on project requirements, design preferences, and the level of customization and control required.
